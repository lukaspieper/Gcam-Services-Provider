This app "simulates" the Google Play Services that the Google Camera app (Gcam) requires, allowing the camera app to be used on devices without Google Play Services. Note that this app comes without UI and therefore has no icon in the app drawer. But of course it is listed in the Android settings (e.g. for uninstallation).

<b>What is the difference between this app and <a href="https://github.com/microg" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">microG</a>?</b>

microG is a open source re-implementation of the Google Play Services (client side). Among other things, <a href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">signature spoofing</a> is used to achieve this goal. In comparison, this app only aims to get Gcam running without Play Services. Therefore this app does not need any security compromising hacks or permissions (no Internet access, no storage access and of course no root access needed).

<b>So what do I have to install?</b>

There are three flavors of this app named <i>basic</i>, <i>photos</i>, and <i>photosonly</i>. All come without UI and therefore have no icon in the app drawer. But of course the installation is listed in the Android settings (e.g. for uninstallation).

<i>Basic</i> includes everything you need to get Gcam running but the button showing the last taken photo in full size will not work. The <i>photosonly</i> flavor supports this button but does not provide the features of the <i>basic</i> flavor; it is meant to be used on GrapheneOS alongside the sandboxed Play Services. The <i>photos</i> flavor has all features from <i>basic</i> and <i>photosonly</i> combined in one app.

<b>It is strongly recommended to read the project page to learn more about compatibility and limitations.</b>

This app is NOT compatible with devices running Google Play Services or microg, installation will fail on these devices. Also, the original Gcam (unmodded) version 7.6 or newer requires a compatible Android version (OS/ROM). More information about this on the project page as well.
